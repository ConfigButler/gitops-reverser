# Post-Refactor Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Related Document**: [`sync-architecture-completion-plan-v4-final.md`](sync-architecture-completion-plan-v4-final.md)

## Overview

After completing the major refactor documented in v4-final plan, several deprecated stubs and unused methods were identified and removed. This cleanup eliminated ~40 lines of dead code that could confuse future maintainers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Deprecated Method: `EmitClusterStateSnapshot`
**File**: [`internal/watch/manager.go`](../internal/watch/manager.go:650)  
**Lines Removed**: 9

**Before**:
```go
// EmitClusterStateSnapshot is deprecated in favor of GetClusterStateForGitDest.
// Kept for backward compatibility but should not be used in new code.
func (m *Manager) EmitClusterStateSnapshot(
	_ context.Context,
	_, _, _, _ string,
) error {
	// Deprecated - use GetClusterStateForGitDest instead
	return nil
}
```

**Reason**: This was a no-op stub replaced by [`GetClusterStateForGitDest()`](../internal/watch/manager.go:662). No callers existed in codebase.

---

### 2. Removed Hollow Registration Methods from BranchWorker
**File**: [`internal/git/branch_worker.go`](../internal/git/branch_worker.go:88)  
**Lines Removed**: 22

**Before**:
```go
// RegisterDestination adds a GitDestination to this worker's tracking.
// Multiple destinations can register if they share the same (repo, branch).
// Note: This method is kept for WorkerManager lifecycle management but no longer
// tracks destinations internally since BranchWorker doesn't need this information.
func (w *BranchWorker) RegisterDestination(destName, _ string, baseFolder string) {
	w.Log.Info("GitDestination registered with worker",
		"destination", destName,
		"baseFolder", baseFolder)
}

// UnregisterDestination removes a GitDestination from tracking.
// Returns true if this was the last destination (worker can be destroyed).
// Note: This method is kept for WorkerManager lifecycle management but no longer
// tracks destinations internally since BranchWorker doesn't need this information.
func (w *BranchWorker) UnregisterDestination(destName, _ string) bool {
	w.Log.Info("GitDestination unregistered from worker",
		"destination", destName)

	// Always return false since BranchWorker no longer tracks destinations.
	// WorkerManager handles the lifecycle decisions.
	return false
}
```

**Reason**: After refactor, BranchWorker no longer tracks individual destinations. WorkerManager handles all lifecycle decisions. These methods only logged messages and returned meaningless values.

**Impact**: 
- [`WorkerManager.RegisterDestination()`](../internal/git/worker_manager.go:54) simplified - removed hollow callback
- Lifecycle now clearer - WorkerManager owns all decisions about worker creation/destruction

---

### 3. Removed Obsolete Test
**File**: [`internal/git/branch_worker_test.go`](../internal/git/branch_worker_test.go:143)  
**Lines Removed**: 25

**Before**:
```go
// TestBranchWorker_RegisterUnregister verifies the simplified register/unregister behavior.
func TestBranchWorker_RegisterUnregister(t *testing.T) {
	// ... tested methods that no longer exist
}
```

**Reason**: Tested methods (`RegisterDestination`, `UnregisterDestination`) were removed from BranchWorker API.

---

### 4. **SEED_SYNC Orphan Detection System (Complete Removal)**
**Locations**: Multiple files  
**Lines Removed**: ~95

**Files Modified**:
- [`internal/watch/manager.go`](../internal/watch/manager.go) - Removed `emitSeedSyncControls()` and BranchKey tracking
- [`internal/git/types.go`](../internal/git/types.go) - Removed `IsControlEvent()` method and SEED_SYNC references
- [`internal/git/git.go`](../internal/git/git.go) - Removed control event filtering
- [`internal/git/types_test.go`](../internal/git/types_test.go) - Removed SEED_SYNC tests

**Before**: Dual Orphan Detection
```
WatchManager seed → Track BranchKeys → Emit SEED_SYNC events → BranchWorker orphan detection
+
FolderReconciler → Compare states → Detect orphans
```

**After**: Single Reconciliation Mechanism
```
FolderReconciler → Compare cluster state vs git state → Emit delete events for orphans
```

**Architecture Benefits**:
- **Simpler**: One orphan detection mechanism instead of two
- **Cleaner events**: No special control events, just CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE
- **Better separation**: FolderReconciler owns reconciliation logic completely
- **Fewer moving parts**: Removed BranchKey tracking from seed operations

**Orphan Detection Now Handled By**:
[`FolderReconciler.reconcile()`](../internal/reconcile/folder_reconciler.go:106) via:
```go
toCreate, toDelete, existingInBoth := r.findDifferences(r.clusterResources, r.gitResources)
// toDelete = resources in Git but not in cluster (orphans)
```

## Verification

All changes verified with:
```bash
make lint       # ✅ 0 issues
make test       # ✅ All tests pass
make lint-fix   # ✅ No imports to clean
```

**Test Coverage Maintained**:
- `internal/git`: 50.9% coverage (unchanged)
- `internal/watch`: 22.6% coverage (unchanged)
- `internal/reconcile`: 58.4% coverage (unchanged)

## Architecture Impact

### Before Cleanup
- WorkerManager → (hollow call) → BranchWorker.RegisterDestination() → (just logs)
- Confusing return value from UnregisterDestination (always false)
- Misleading method names suggesting tracking that didn't happen

### After Cleanup
- WorkerManager → (direct worker creation/destruction)
- Clear ownership: WorkerManager owns lifecycle
- No misleading APIs suggesting non-existent behavior

## Related Architecture

The cleanup aligns with the completed refactor architecture:

```
GitDestination Controller
   ↓
WorkerManager (owns lifecycle)
   ↓ creates/destroys
BranchWorker (pure Git service)
   - No destination tracking
   - No event knowledge beyond Event struct
   - Synchronous ListResourcesInBaseFolder() service
```

## Remaining Patterns Still Needed

These patterns were NOT removed (still active):
- ✅ [`BranchKey`](../internal/git/types.go:29) - Worker identification
- ✅ [`Event`](../internal/git/types.go:54) struct - Git operation events
- ✅ [`ListResourcesInBaseFolder()`](../internal/git/branch_worker.go:165) - Active service method
- ✅ [`ResourceReference`](../internal/types/reference.go:25) - Clean GitDest references

## Summary

**Total Lines Removed**: 152+
**Dead Code Eliminated**:
- 1 deprecated method (`EmitClusterStateSnapshot`)
- 2 hollow registration methods (`RegisterDestination`, `UnregisterDestination`)
- 1 complete orphan detection system (SEED_SYNC mechanism)
- 3 obsolete tests

**Maintainability**: Significantly improved
- No confusing deprecated stubs
- Single orphan detection mechanism (FolderReconciler)
- Clearer event lifecycle (no control events)
- Simpler seeding logic (no BranchKey tracking)

**Test Status**: ✅ All passing
**Lint Status**: ✅ Clean
**Coverage**: Maintained (watch: 22.9%, git: 50.9%, reconcile: 58.4%)

The codebase now fully reflects the completed v4 architecture with:
- Clean [`ResourceReference`](../internal/types/reference.go:25) pattern throughout
- No deprecated or misleading APIs
- Clear separation: WorkerManager owns lifecycle, BranchWorker provides Git services
- **Single reconciliation mechanism** via FolderReconciler (no dual orphan detection)
- **Simple event model**: CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE only (no control events)
