# Git Safe Directory - Deep Dive

## 🔒 What Is Git Safe Directory?

Git Safe Directory is a security feature introduced in **Git 2.35.2** (April 2022) to prevent a specific attack vector called "directory ownership mismatch exploit".

## 🎯 The Problem It Solves

### The Security Issue

**Scenario:**
```bash
# Attacker creates malicious .git/config on shared system
/shared/project/.git/config
  └─ Contains: [core] pager = malicious-script

# Victim runs git command as their user
cd /shared/project
git log  # Triggers malicious pager script
```

**Why dangerous:**
- Git reads `.git/config` which could be owned by another user
- Malicious hooks or configuration could execute attacker's code
- Particularly dangerous in multi-user systems

### Git's Solution

Git now refuses to work in repositories where the `.git` directory is owned by a different user:

```bash
fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/path/to/repo'
To add an exception for this directory, call:
    git config --global --add safe.directory /path/to/repo
```

## 🐳 Why This Happens in Containers

### Ownership Mismatch in CI

**GitHub Actions + Container:**
```yaml
container:
  image: my-dev-container
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v5  # Checks out code on HOST
  - run: git status           # Runs inside CONTAINER
```

**What happens:**

1. **Checkout on host** (as user `runner`, UID 1001)
   ```
   /__w/gitops-reverser/gitops-reverser/
   └─ .git/        (owned by runner:docker, UID 1001)
   └─ go.mod       (owned by runner:docker, UID 1001)
   ```

2. **Container runs as root** (UID 0)
   ```
   # Inside container (UID 0)
   git status  # ← Git sees .git owned by UID 1001, refuses to work
   ```

3. **Git's perspective:**
   - Current user: root (UID 0)
   - Repository owner: runner (UID 1001)
   - **Ownership mismatch → Security risk → ABORT**

### Why Our CI Needs It

```yaml
jobs:
  lint-and-test:
    container:
      image: ghcr.io/.../gitops-reverser-devcontainer
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5  # ← Creates files as host user
      
      - run: make lint              # ← Git reads files in linting
                                    #   Error without safe.directory!
```

**Without safe.directory config:**
```
cmd/main.go:1: : error obtaining VCS status: exit status 128
```

**With safe.directory config:**
```yaml
- name: Configure Git safe directory
  run: git config --global --add safe.directory /__w/gitops-reverser/gitops-reverser
```
✅ Git works normally

## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

### How Git Checks Ownership

From Git source code (`setup.c`):
```c
static int ensure_valid_ownership(const char *path)
{
    struct stat st;
    if (stat(path, &st) < 0)
        return 0;
    
    // Check if directory owner matches current user
    if (st.st_uid != geteuid()) {
        // Ownership mismatch detected!
        return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}
```

### The Safe Directory Mechanism

Git maintains a list of "trusted" directories in config:

```bash
# Global config (~/.gitconfig)
[safe]
    directory = /path/to/trusted/repo1
    directory = /path/to/trusted/repo2
    directory = *  # Trust all (dangerous!)
```

When you run `git config --global --add safe.directory /path`:
1. Git adds path to global config
2. Subsequent git commands in that path bypass ownership check
3. Git trusts that you've verified the repository

## 🛡️ Security Implications

### Why It's Generally Safe in CI

**In CI containers:**
```yaml
container:
  image: ghcr.io/.../dev-container
```

**Why trust is reasonable:**
1. **Ephemeral** - Container is destroyed after job
2. **Isolated** - No other users can modify .git
3. **Controlled** - GitHub Actions checks out code
4. **Immutable** - Code comes from trusted source (your repo)

**Attack surface:**
- ❌ Attacker cannot modify .git on GitHub
- ❌ Attacker cannot modify container image (signed)
- ❌ Attacker cannot inject code into checkout
- ✅ Safe to trust the directory

### Why NOT Use `directory = *` (Trust All)

```bash
# DON'T DO THIS
git config --global --add safe.directory '*'
```

**Problems:**
- Disables protection globally
- Makes Git ignore ownership everywhere
- Could mask real security issues
- Defeats the purpose of the feature

**Better:** Explicitly list trusted paths
```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory /workspace
git config --global --add safe.directory /__w/gitops-reverser/gitops-reverser
```

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Fix Ownership (Not Practical in CI)

```dockerfile
# In Dockerfile - create matching user
RUN useradd -u 1001 -m runner
USER runner
```

**Problems:**
- UID varies across CI providers
- GitHub Actions uses UID 1001, others may differ
- Requires knowledge of host UID at build time
- Breaks root-required operations

### Option 2: Disable VCS in Go Build

```bash
# Workaround for specific tools
go build -buildvcs=false
```

**Problems:**
- Only fixes Go build, not general Git operations
- Loses VCS information in binaries
- Doesn't help with git-based tools
- Incomplete solution

### Option 3: Run Container as Non-Root (Complex)

```yaml
container:
  image: my-dev-container
  options: --user 1001:1001
```

**Problems:**
- Must match GitHub Actions UID (1001)
- Breaks tools requiring root
- File permissions become complex
- Not worth the complexity

### ✅ Option 4: Safe Directory Config (Our Choice)

```yaml
- name: Configure Git safe directory
  run: git config --global --add safe.directory ${{ github.workspace }}
```

**Why best:**
- Simple one-liner
- Works in all containers
- Explicit about what's trusted
- No build-time UID matching needed
- Doesn't break other functionality

## 📋 When Do You Need This?

### Scenarios Requiring safe.directory

**✅ Need it:**
- Running Git in containers (different UID from checkout)
- CI/CD with containers (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Development containers (VS Code Dev Containers)
- Docker-based development workflows
- Any scenario with ownership mismatch

**❌ Don't need it:**
- Running Git normally on host
- Container and checkout same user
- Using git inside container that also checks out
- No ownership mismatch

### Quick Decision Tree

```
Is Git refusing to work with "dubious ownership" error?
├─ YES → Add safe.directory config
│   └─ Is this a CI/CD container?
│       ├─ YES → Safe to add (ephemeral, isolated)
│       └─ NO → Verify repository trust first
└─ NO → No action needed
```

## 🔍 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: GitHub Actions with Container

```yaml
# ERROR: Without safe.directory
jobs:
  test:
    container: golang:1.25
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - run: git status
        # ❌ fatal: dubious ownership
```

```yaml
# FIXED: With safe.directory
jobs:
  test:
    container: golang:1.25
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - run: |
          git config --global --add safe.directory $PWD
          git status
        # ✅ Works!
```

### Example 2: VS Code Dev Containers

**devcontainer.json:**
```json
{
  "remoteUser": "root",
  "postCreateCommand": "git config --global --add safe.directory /workspace"
}
```

**Why:** VS Code mounts workspace (owned by host user) into container (running as root)

### Example 3: Docker Compose Development

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  dev:
    image: golang:1.25
    volumes:
      - .:/workspace  # Host files → container
    command: |
      sh -c "
        git config --global --add safe.directory /workspace
        make test
      "
```

## 📚 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
1. **Be specific** - List exact directories
2. **Document why** - Comment your config commands
3. **Verify trust** - Ensure repository is actually safe
4. **Use variables** - `${{ github.workspace }}`, `$PWD`, etc.

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Use wildcards** - Avoid `safe.directory = *`
2. **Ignore errors** - Understand why Git is complaining
3. **Disable globally** - Only in CI containers, not everywhere
4. **Skip in production** - Keep security checks in prod environments

## 🧪 Testing Safe Directory Config

### Verify It Works

```bash
# Test in container
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace golang:1.25 sh -c "
  cd /workspace
  git status  # Should fail
  
  git config --global --add safe.directory /workspace
  git status  # Should work
"
```

### Check Current Safe Directories

```bash
# List all safe directories
git config --global --get-all safe.directory

# Output example:
/workspace
/__w/gitops-reverser/gitops-reverser
```

### Remove If Needed

```bash
# Remove specific directory
git config --global --unset-all safe.directory /workspace

# Remove all
git config --global --remove-section safe
```

## 🎓 Additional Context

### When Was This Introduced?

- **Git 2.35.2** (April 2022) - Security fix
- **CVE-2022-24765** - The vulnerability it addresses
- **Widespread impact** - Affected all Git users
- **CI breaking** - Many CI pipelines broke overnight

### Why It Matters for GitOps

In GitOps workflows:
- Git is heavily used (diffs, commits, status checks)
- Often runs in containers for consistency
- Ownership mismatches are common
- Understanding this prevents mysterious failures

### Reading the Error Message

```
fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/__w/gitops-reverser/gitops-reverser'
To add an exception for this directory, call:
    git config --global --add safe.directory /__w/gitops-reverser/gitops-reverser
```

**What it means:**
- `dubious ownership` = UID mismatch detected
- `repository at '...'` = Specific path with issue
- `git config --global --add safe.directory` = Exact fix needed
- Git is protecting you from potential attack

## 🎯 Summary

**Git Safe Directory:**
- 🔒 Security feature preventing ownership exploit
- 🐳 Commonly needed in container workflows
- ✅ Safe to use in ephemeral CI containers
- 📝 Should be explicit about trusted paths
- 🚫 Don't disable globally with wildcards

**In our implementation:**
```yaml
- name: Configure Git safe directory
  run: git config --global --add safe.directory /__w/gitops-reverser/gitops-reverser
```

This tells Git: "I trust this specific repository despite the UID mismatch, because I know it's safe in this ephemeral CI container environment."

**It's a pragmatic security trade-off that makes sense in containerized workflows!**
