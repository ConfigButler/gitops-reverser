# GitOps Reverser

GitOps Reverser is a Kubernetes operator that captures cluster changes (through a ValidatingWebhookConfiguration). The operator commits them to Git as yaml files, creating a file based reprentation of your current desired state. Every change becomes an annotated commit, giving you an audit trail.

# Why?

We love GitOps. It gives us a single source of truth, an audit trail, and safe, automated deployments. We also love the Kubernetes API. It's a universal, battle-tested control plane that gives us a powerful, declarative interface for managing any kind resources.

But today, we are forced to choose between them:

* The Pure GitOps Flow: Developers make changes exclusively in Git. This is safe but can be slow and cumbersome for simple configuration updates, often requiring developers to be YAML and Git experts.

* The API-First Flow: Developers or UIs make changes directly to the cluster. This is fast and interactive but breaks the "Git as the source of truth" principle, creating a "Wild West" of untracked changes.

How can we get the interactive, immediate feedback of an API without sacrificing the safety and transparency of a Git-based workflow?

GitOps-Reverser is the bridge. It's a lightweight Kubernetes admission webhook that implements a powerful "Reverse GitOps" pattern. It lets you use the Kubernetes API as the user-friendly "frontend" for a rock-solid GitOps backend.

# How?

GitOps-Reverser intercepts them and translates them into a safe, auditable Git workflow.

How It Works: The "Sandbox-First" Workflow
Propose a Change: A developer (or a UI) makes a configuration change using the standard Kubernetes API (kubectl edit, or a PATCH request).

Intercept & Fork: GitOps-Reverser intercepts the API call. Instead of applying it, it automatically creates a new Git branch and opens a Pull Request with the proposed change.

Test in Isolation: The new PR triggers a CI pipeline (using tools like Tekton) that spins up an ephemeral "sandbox" namespace. The proposed configuration is deployed and tested in complete isolation.

Review & Merge: The team reviews the PR, which now includes the successful test results. Once approved, the change is merged into the main branch.

Deploy with Confidence: A standard GitOps tool (like Flux or Argo CD) detects the merge and safely reconciles the change to your production environment.

The Benefits
The Best of Both Worlds: Get the interactive, user-friendly experience of an API and the safety, audit trail, and peer-review process of Git.

Enhanced Developer Experience: Developers can make changes in safe, temporary sandboxes without needing deep Git expertise for every small update.

Unlock Automation and AI: By creating a standard, API-driven contract for configuration, we pave the way for a future where AI agents and interoperable tools can safely and declaratively manage our systems.

In short, GitOps-Reverser lets you stop choosing between speed and safety, giving you a truly cloud-native way to manage your application's configuration.

## What It Does

When you make manual changes to your Kubernetes cluster (hotfixes, emergency patches, configuration updates), GitOps Reverser:
- Captures changes in real-time via admission webhooks
- Sanitizes and formats them as clean YAML manifests
- Commits them to your Git repository with detailed metadata
- Handles conflicts intelligently

### Configure Repository

```yaml
apiVersion: configbutler.ai/v1alpha1
kind: GitRepoConfig
metadata:
  name: audit-repo
  namespace: gitops-reverser-system
spec:
  url: "git@github.com:yourorg/k8s-audit.git"
  branch: "main"
  secretRef:
    name: git-credentials
```

### Create Watch Rules

#### Example 1: Watch ConfigMaps and Secrets

```yaml
apiVersion: configbutler.ai/v1alpha1
kind: WatchRule
metadata:
  name: config-audit
  namespace: production
spec:
  gitRepoConfigRef: audit-repo
  rules:
  - resources: [configmaps, secrets]
```

#### Example 2: Watch Only CREATE and UPDATE Operations

```yaml
apiVersion: configbutler.ai/v1alpha1
kind: WatchRule
metadata:
  name: app-deployments
  namespace: production
spec:
  gitRepoConfigRef: audit-repo
  rules:
  - operations: [CREATE, UPDATE]  # Ignore DELETE
    apiGroups: [apps]
    apiVersions: [v1]
    resources: [deployments, statefulsets]
```

#### Example 3: Filter by Labels

```yaml
apiVersion: configbutler.ai/v1alpha1
kind: WatchRule
metadata:
  name: production-only
  namespace: production
spec:
  gitRepoConfigRef: audit-repo
  objectSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: environment
      operator: In
      values: [production]
    - key: gitops-reverser.io/ignore
      operator: DoesNotExist
  rules:
  - resources: ["*"]
```

#### Example 4: Watch Custom Resources

```yaml
apiVersion: configbutler.ai/v1alpha1
kind: WatchRule
metadata:
  name: my-crds
  namespace: production
spec:
  gitRepoConfigRef: audit-repo
  rules:
  - apiGroups: [example.com]
    resources: [myapps, databases]
```

### Apply Configuration

```bash
kubectl apply -f gitrepoconfig.yaml
kubectl apply -f watchrule.yaml
```

## WatchRule Reference

### Spec Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `gitRepoConfigRef` | string | Yes | Name of GitRepoConfig (must be in same namespace) |
| `objectSelector` | LabelSelector | No | Filter resources by labels |
| `rules[]` | []ResourceRule | Yes | Resources to watch (logical OR) |

### ResourceRule Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `resources` | []string | Yes | Resource types (e.g., `pods`, `deployments`) |
| `operations` | []OperationType | No | Operations to watch: `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `*` |
| `apiGroups` | []string | No | API groups (`""` = core, `apps`, etc.) |
| `apiVersions` | []string | No | API versions (`v1`, `v1beta1`, etc.) |

### Wildcards

- `"*"` - Matches all resources
- `"pods"` - Exact match (case-insensitive)
- `"pods/*"` - All pod subresources (pods/log, pods/status)
- `"pods/log"` - Specific subresource

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Prefix/suffix wildcards like `pod*` or `*.example.com` are NOT supported

## Repository Structure

Changes are organized in your Git repository as:

```
<repo-root>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <apiGroup>/<version>/<resources>/<namespace>/<name>.yaml
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ v1/configmaps/production/app-config.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ v1/secrets/production/db-credentials.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/v1/deployments/production/web-app.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.com/v1/myapps/production/my-custom-resource.yaml
```

Each commit includes detailed metadata:
```
[CREATE] ConfigMap/app-config in ns/production by admin@company.com

- Resource: ConfigMap/app-config
- Namespace: production
- Operation: CREATE
- User: admin@company.com
- Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:30:00Z
```

## Security Model

### Namespace Isolation

WatchRule is namespace-scoped and can **only watch resources in its own namespace**:

```yaml
# This WatchRule in namespace 'team-a'...
apiVersion: configbutler.ai/v1alpha1
kind: WatchRule
metadata:
  name: my-rule
  namespace: team-a  # ‚Üê Can ONLY watch resources in team-a
spec:
  gitRepoConfigRef: my-repo
  rules:
  - resources: [pods, configmaps]
```

**Benefits:**
- Multi-tenancy: Teams can only watch their own resources
- Least privilege: No cross-namespace visibility
- RBAC integration: Kubernetes RBAC controls WatchRule creation per namespace

### Cluster-Scoped Resources

Cluster-scoped resources (Nodes, ClusterRoles, Namespaces, etc.) require ClusterWatchRule (docs to be added)

## Important: Avoiding Infinite Loops

**Do NOT run traditional GitOps tools (Argo CD/Flux) and GitOps Reverser on the same resources in fully automated mode.**

This creates an infinite loop:
1. GitOps Reverser sees manual change ‚Üí pushes to Git
2. Argo CD sees Git changed ‚Üí "corrects" cluster
3. GitOps Reverser sees "correction" ‚Üí pushes to Git
4. Loop repeats endlessly

### Recommended Usage Patterns

1. **Audit-Only**: Capture changes without automated enforcement
2. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Allow hotfixes, capture in Git, humans review
3. **Drift Detection**: Use commits as input for alerting systems
4. **Hybrid GitOps**: Run traditional GitOps on infrastructure, GitOps Reverser on configurations

## Monitoring

GitOps Reverser exports OpenTelemetry metrics:

- `gitops_reverser_events_received_total` - Webhook events received
- `gitops_reverser_events_processed_total` - Events successfully processed
- `gitops_reverser_git_operations_total` - Git operations count
- `gitops_reverser_git_push_duration_seconds` - Git push duration
- `gitops_reverser_git_commit_queue_size` - Event queue size

## Development

```bash
# Run unit tests
make test

# Run linter
make lint

# Run e2e tests
make test-e2e

# Build locally
make build
```

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) for detailed development information.

### Key Components

- **Admission Webhooks**: Capture changes in real-time
- **Event Queue**: Buffer and batch changes for efficient processing
- **Git Worker**: Handle repository operations with conflict resolution
- **Sanitization Engine**: Clean manifests (remove status, server-managed fields)
- **Rule Engine**: Configure which resources to track with fine-grained filters

## Troubleshooting

### Git Authentication Failures

```bash
# Check controller logs
kubectl logs -n gitops-reverser-system deployment/gitops-reverser-controller

# Verify secret exists
kubectl get secret git-credentials -n gitops-reverser-system
```

### Webhook Not Triggering

```bash
# Check webhook registration
kubectl get validatingwebhookconfigurations

# Check webhook service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints gitops-reverser-webhook-service -n gitops-reverser-system
```

### No Events in Queue

```bash
# Check if WatchRule is ready
kubectl get watchrule -A

# View WatchRule status
kubectl describe watchrule <name> -n <namespace>
```

## Other tools

| **Tool** | **How it Works** | **Key Difference from GitOps Reverser** | 
|---|---|---|
| [RichardoC/kube-audit-rest](https://github.com/RichardoC/kube-audit-rest) | An admission webhook that receives audit events and exposes them over a REST API. | **Action vs. Transport:** `kube-audit-rest` is a transport layer. GitOps Reverser is an *action* layer that consumes the event and commits it to Git. | 
| https://github.com/robusta-dev/robusta | A broad observability and automation platform. | **Focused Tool vs. Broad Platform:** Robusta is a large platform. GitOps Reverser is a small, single-purpose utility focused on simplicity and low overhead. | 
| [bpineau/katafygio](https://github.com/bpineau/katafygio) | Periodically scans the cluster and dumps all resources to a Git repository. | **Event-Driven vs. Snapshot:** Katafygio is a backup tool. GitOps Reverser is event-driven, providing a real-time audit trail. |
