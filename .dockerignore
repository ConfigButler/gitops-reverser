# This .dockerignore file uses an "allowlist" approach for security and a minimal build context.
# For more info: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file

# 1. Ignore everything by default.
**

# 2. Explicitly re-include only the files and directories needed for the build.
# This is based on the COPY instructions in the Dockerfile.
