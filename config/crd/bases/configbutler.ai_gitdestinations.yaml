          GitDestination binds repo+branch+baseFolder for a write subtree in Git.
          Each GitDestination must have a unique combination of (resolved_repo_url, branch, baseFolder)
          to prevent conflicts when writing to Git. This uniqueness constraint is enforced via
          an admission webhook.
