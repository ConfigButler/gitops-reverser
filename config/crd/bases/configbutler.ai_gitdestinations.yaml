          GitDestination binds repo+branch+baseFolder for a write subtree in Git.
          Each GitDestination must have a unique combination of (resolved_repo_url, branch, baseFolder)
          to prevent conflicts when writing to Git. This uniqueness constraint is enforced via
          an admission webhook.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
