          ClusterWatchRule watches resources across the entire cluster.
          It provides the ability to audit both cluster-scoped resources (Nodes, ClusterRoles, CRDs)
          and namespaced resources across multiple namespaces with per-rule filtering.

          Security model:
            - ClusterWatchRule is cluster-scoped and requires cluster-admin permissions
            - Referenced GitRepoConfig must have accessPolicy.allowClusterRules set to true
            - Each rule can independently specify Cluster or Namespaced scope
            - Namespaced rules can optionally filter by namespace labels

          Use cases:
            - Audit cluster infrastructure (Nodes, PersistentVolumes, StorageClasses)
            - Audit RBAC changes (ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings)
            - Audit CRD installations and updates
            - Audit resources across multiple namespaces (e.g., all production namespaces)
