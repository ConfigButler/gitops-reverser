          WatchRule watches namespaced resources within its own namespace.
          It provides fine-grained control over which resources trigger Git commits,
          with filtering by operation type, API group, version, and labels.

          Security model:
            - WatchRule is namespace-scoped and can only watch resources in its own namespace
            - Use ClusterWatchRule for watching cluster-scoped resources (Nodes, ClusterRoles, etc.)
            - RBAC controls who can create/modify WatchRules per namespace

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.

                  Pointer is used so that omitempty truly omits the field when unset to avoid

                  Multiple rules create a logical OR - a resource matching ANY rule is watched.

                    This follows Kubernetes admission control semantics but simplified for our use case.
                    All fields except Resources are optional and default to matching all when not specified.

                        Wildcards supported: "*" matches all groups.
                        Examples:
                          - [""] matches core API (pods, services, configmaps)

                        Wildcards supported: "*" matches all versions.
                        Examples:
                          - ["v1"] matches only v1 version
                          - ["v1", "v1beta1"] matches both versions

                        This field is required and determines which resource types trigger this rule.
                        Wildcard semantics follow Kubernetes admission webhook patterns:
                          - "*" matches all resources
                          - "pods" matches exactly pods (case-insensitive)
                          - "pods/*" matches all pod subresources (e.g., pods/log, pods/status)
                          - "pods/log" matches specific subresource

                        For custom resources, use exact group-qualified names:
                          - "myapps.example.com" matches MyApp CRD

                        Note: Prefix/suffix wildcards like "pod*" or "*.example.com" are NOT supported.
                        Use exact matches or the "*" wildcard for broad matching.
