          WatchRule watches namespaced resources within its own namespace.
          It provides fine-grained control over which resources trigger Git commits,
          with filtering by operation type, API group, version, and labels.

          Security model:
            - WatchRule is namespace-scoped and can only watch resources in its own namespace
            - Use ClusterWatchRule for watching cluster-scoped resources (Nodes, ClusterRoles, etc.)
            - RBAC controls who can create/modify WatchRules per namespace

                        For custom resources, use exact group-qualified names:
