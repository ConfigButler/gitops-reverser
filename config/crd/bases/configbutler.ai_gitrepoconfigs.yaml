              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

            properties:
              allowedBranches:
                description: |-
                  AllowedBranches is the list of Git branches that GitDestinations may reference.
                  This provides a simple allowlist mechanism for branch validation.
                  Each entry supports glob patterns (e.g., "main", "feature/*", "release/v*").
                  A branch is allowed if it matches ANY pattern in this list (OR logic).
                  Invalid glob patterns are logged as warnings but don't prevent validation.
                  GitDestination resources referencing this GitRepoConfig must specify a branch
                  that matches at least one pattern in this list.

                  For SSH repositories the Secret must contain 'identity'
                  and 'known_hosts' fields.
