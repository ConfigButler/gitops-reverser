# Mutation-capture lab

A small, separate application that records the exact structures Kubernetes
exposes through native watches, audit webhooks, and validating admission
webhooks, and commits them as a versioned corpus. It is **not** a second
GitOps Reverser — see [the design](../../docs/design/mutation-capture-lab-design.md).

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `cmd/mutation-capture-lab/` | the lab binary (recorders + records API) |
| `internal/mutationlab/` | record model, normalizer, store, corpus, recorders, API |
| `test/mutationlab/Dockerfile` | the lab image (built only by `task lab-build-image`) |
| `test/mutationlab/swap-image.sh` | swaps the lab image onto the controller Deployment |
| `test/mutationlab/e2e/` | the live-cluster driver (build tag `mutationlab_e2e`) |
| `test/mutationlab/corpus/` | the committed golden corpus + `CLUSTER.md` provenance |

## Scenario index

Each captured row of the [Difficult Cases Catalog](../../docs/design/mutation-capture-lab-design.md#difficult-cases-catalog)
maps to one driver test and one corpus directory. The "Sources" column is what the
corpus commits — a **silence** (no audit / no admission) is itself the finding, not a
gap (see [Capturing Intent, Not State](../../docs/design/mutation-capture-lab-design.md#capturing-intent-not-state)).

| Row | Scenario | Test (`e2e/…`) | Corpus dir (`corpus/…`) | Sources committed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create succeeds | `configmap_scenarios_test.go` · `TestCreateSucceeds` | `configmap/create-succeeds/` | watch, audit, admission |
| 2 | Update (PUT) | `configmap_scenarios_test.go` · `TestUpdate` | `configmap/update/` | watch, audit, admission |
| 3 | Server-side apply | `configmap_scenarios_test.go` · `TestServerSideApply` | `configmap/server-side-apply/` | watch MODIFIED, audit (`patch`, apply field manager), admission UPDATE (apply options) |
| 4 | No-op apply | `configmap_scenarios_test.go` · `TestNoOpApply` | `configmap/no-op-apply/` | audit, admission — **no** watch (resourceVersion unchanged) |
| 5 | Status subresource | `workload_scenarios_test.go` · `TestStatusSubresource` | `deployment/status-update/` | watch ×2 — **no** audit, **no** admission |
| 6 | Scale subresource | `workload_scenarios_test.go` · `TestScaleSubresource` | `deployment/scale-patch/` | watch, audit — **no** admission |
| 7 | Graceful delete | `workload_scenarios_test.go` · `TestGracefulDelete` | `pod/graceful-delete/` | watch (MODIFIED + DELETED), admission — **no** audit |
| 8 | Finalizer delete | `configmap_scenarios_test.go` · `TestFinalizerDelete` | `configmap/finalizer-delete/` | watch (MODIFIED + DELETED), audit (delete + patch — **no** second delete), admission (DELETE + UPDATE) |
| 9 | Deletecollection | `configmap_scenarios_test.go` · `TestDeletecollection` | `configmap/deletecollection/` | watch ×N, audit ×1 (name-less), admission ×N (per object) |
| 10 | Owner-ref cascade | `configmap_scenarios_test.go` · `TestOwnerRefCascade` | `configmap/owner-ref-cascade/` | watch DELETED ×2 (parent + cascaded child), audit ×2 (parent = human, child = `generic-garbage-collector`) |
| 11 | Dry-run create | `configmap_scenarios_test.go` · `TestDryRunCreate` | `configmap/dry-run-create/` | audit, admission — **no** watch / **no** etcd object |
| 12 | Record-and-reject | `configmap_scenarios_test.go` · `TestRecordAndReject` | `configmap/record-and-reject/` | audit, admission — **no** watch / **no** etcd object |
| 13 | Optimistic-concurrency conflict | `configmap_scenarios_test.go` · `TestOptimisticConcurrencyConflict` | `configmap/conflict-update/` | audit ×1 (`update`, code 409) — **no** watch / **no** admission (rejected at storage, before admission) |
| 14 | Multi-version CRD conversion | `crd_conversion_test.go` · `TestCRDConversion` | `widget/crd-conversion/` | watch (v2), audit (v1), admission (v1), conversion ×2 (both directions) |
| 15 | Aggregated API write | `aggregated_api_test.go` · `TestAggregatedAPIWrite` | `flunder/aggregated-api-write/` | watch (full object), audit (empty body); admission is observed but not committed |
| 16 | Watch resync (`410 Gone`) | `watch_transport_test.go` · `TestWatchExpiredResourceVersion` | `configmap/watch-resync/` | watch ERROR (`Status` 410); driver verifies relist recovery |
| 17 | Bookmark | `watch_transport_test.go` · `TestWatchBookmark` | `configmap/watch-bookmark/` | watch BOOKMARK with resourceVersion |

All seventeen catalogued scenarios are now captured. Rows 16 and 17 test the watch
transport itself; the driver uses the lab's targeted `/watch-probe` endpoint so
transport-only events can be scenario-attributed — see the
[watch-first ingestion architecture](../../docs/design/watch-first-ingestion-architecture.md)
design notes.

## How it integrates: swap the image, reuse the wiring

The lab serves the **same** webhook URLs as the product —
`/validate-all` and `/audit-webhook` — on the same ports and TLS cert mounts. So
making a cluster capture with the lab is just swapping the controller image: no
new audit policy, webhook config, or certificates. `task lab-e2e` does this on the
already-prepared e2e cluster, then drives the scenarios serially.

Row 15 (aggregated API write) is what settled the body-enrichment question: the
official audit event for an aggregated-API write carries an empty body, yet the
live watch carries the full object. Because the watch supplies the object content
natively, the supplementary `/audit-webhook-additional` body-enrichment proxy was
retired — so the lab no longer serves or records that endpoint.

## Running it (opt-in, serial)

These targets are **not** part of `task test-e2e` or the default CI lane.

```bash
# Prepare the e2e cluster + product wiring, swap in the lab image, capture, diff:
task lab-e2e

# Accept a new/changed capture as the golden corpus:
task lab-corpus-update
```

`task lab-e2e` leaves the cluster running the lab image. To restore the product:

```bash
task clean-cluster && task test-e2e
```

The unit tests for the lab packages run in the normal lane (`task test`); the
`test/mutationlab/e2e/` driver is behind the `mutationlab_e2e` build tag and only
runs under `task lab-e2e`.

## Validating a new Kubernetes version

Bump the k3d image, run `task lab-corpus-update`, and review the `corpus/` diff:
it is the behavioral changelog for the upgrade, scoped to exactly the fine-grained
behaviors GitOps Reverser depends on. An empty diff is a positive result.
